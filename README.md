You will need to have Node.js installed on your devide

# Installing React JS
Create a new project folder.
Open the command terminal with your project folder as the directory.

1. Begin by typing the following command in the terminal

### `npx create-react-app [your-project-name]`

This will install react into your folder

2. Thereafter we will open react in the a code editor. I am using VSCode

We have succesfully installed react js in our project folder

# Installing react libraries
I used react-router-dom and react-icons for the purposes of my webpage. To install it open
a new terminal in VSCode with your folder as the directory and enter the following:

### `npm install react-router-dome`

### `npm install react-icons`

# Running the App in development mode
To view your app in a browser window you can use the following command:

# Deployment

To deploy my app I used netlify. I created a netlify account and uploaded the build folder
to deploy the app and thereafter customized the domain name.

## Creating a build folder

To create a build folder enter the following command in your terminal:

###'npm run build'

This folder is the one uploaded to a hosting site.

Thank you!
